# React Hooks

<br /><br />

## What are hooks?
Hooks is a new API for React introduced in version 16.8 (released in February 2019). They let us use
state and other React features without writing classes.

The main motivation behind this new API was the ability of creating reusable logic, including state,
and plugging it into React components. So the goal is similar to Higher Order Components or Render
Props patterns, but Hooks resolve a lot of the issues of its predecessors and are much simpler to
use. Another big benefit is the possibility to put interconnected logic close to each other, and in
reality components using hooks result in much shorter code. In general they provide a good developer
experience.

usePubNub from our React SDK is in fact a React hook, providing a PubNub instance into client
components. The word “use” at the beginning of every hook is a name convention set by the React
authors.

## Custom Chat Hooks

Apart from the actual components, the Chat Components package comes with a set of custom React
Hooks. The hooks were created to easily fetch metadata stored within **PubNub Objects** and pass it
directly into components.

You can skip this section if metadata is handled externally. Otherwise, you can use PubNub's
infrastrucutre to store your data prior to, or during the runtime of your application using our
standard JavaScript SDK methods.
