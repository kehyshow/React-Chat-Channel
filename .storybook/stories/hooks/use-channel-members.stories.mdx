<Meta title="Custom Hooks/useChannelMembers" />

## useChannelMembers

The hook returns a list of members in a channel. The list will include user metadata for members that have additional metadata stored in the database.
Pagination is handled internally, you can adjust the `limit` of returned members on a single call (max/default 100) and call a function returned by the hook to get another page of results.
This hook also sets up a listener that will react to updates and removals of already fetched Members.
However, this behavior requires a living subscription to the channel getting updated - this should be handled by the components.

```js
const [members, fetchPage, total, error] = useChannelMembers({ channel: 'channel' });

return (
  <Chat {...{ options }}>
    <MemberList memberList={members} />
  </Chat>
)
```
