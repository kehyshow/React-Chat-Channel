<Meta title="Custom Hooks/useUser" />

## useUser

Returns metadata for the specified UUID, optionally including its custom data object.
This hook also sets up a listener that will react to updates of the fetched user.
However, this behavior requires a living subscription to the user getting updated - this should be handled by the components.

This hook can be used in order not to fetch data about all users of the application.
Instead, only the current user metadata is passed into the Chat provider and a `senderInfo` option is enabled on the MessageInput.
This way info about users senders will be attached directly in the messages.

```js
const [user, error] = useUser({ uuid: 'user' });

return (
  <Chat userList={[user]}>
    <MessageInput senderInfo={true} />
  </Chat>
)
 ```
