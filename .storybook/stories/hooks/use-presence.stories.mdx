<Meta title="Custom Hooks/usePresence" />

## usePresence

Returns the list of unique user-ids currently subscribed to the channel.
This hook also sets up a listener that will react to new presence events (joins and leaves/timeouts).
However, this behavior requires a living subscription to the channels passed to the hook - this should be handled by the components.

Information returned by this hook can be used to show a presence indicator, or a number of people currently subscribed to the channel.

```js
  const [channels, totalPresence, error] = usePresence({ channels: ['channel'] });

return (
  <p>Users on the channel: {totalPresence}</p>
)
 ```

### Input

| Parameter |	Type |	Required | Defaults |	Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| channels | Array | Optional | | Specifies the channel name to return occupancy results. If channel is not provided, hereNow() will return data for all channels. |
| channelGroups | Array | Optional | | The channel group for which here now information should be received. |
| includeUUIDs | Boolean | Optional | true | Setting uuid to false disables the return of uuids. |
| includeState | Boolean | Optional | false | Setting state to true enables the return of subscriber state information. |
