## PubNub Account

Sign in or create an account to create an app on the [Admin Portal](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/) and get the keys to use in your
application.

When you create a new app, the first set of keys is generated automatically, but a single app can
have as many keysets as you like. We recommend that you create separate keysets for production and
test environments.

Please make sure to enable `Objects` functionality and select a geographical region corresponding to
most users of your application.

## Installation

Install the components and all required dependencies using npm:

> Please note that the components are not deployed to npm yet!

```bash
npm install --save pubnub pubnub-react pubnub-chat-components
```

## Usage

1. Import PubNub, PubNub React Provider and the components

```js
import { PubNub } from "pubnub";
import { PubNubProvider } from "pubnub-react";
import {
  Chat,
  MessageList,
  MessageInput,
  ChannelList,
  MemberList,
} from "pubnub-chat-components";
```

2. Create your PubNub client and rest of the configuration for the Chat provider.

```jsx
const pubnub = new PubNub({
  publishKey: "myPublishKey",
  subscribeKey: "mySubscribeKey",
  uuid: "myUniqueUUID",
});
const channel = "myCurrentChannel";
const theme = "light";
```

3. Feed the PubNub Provider with your newly created client as with other PubNub React applications.

```jsx
const MyCommponent = () => {
  return (
    <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}>
    </PubNub>
  );
};
```

4. Place the components within the Chat state provider in any order that your app requires. Components
   can be tweaked later on using option properties and CSS variables.

```jsx
const MyCommponent = () => {
  return (
    <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}>
      <Chat {...{ channel, theme }}>
        <MessageList>
        <MessageInput>
      </Chat>
    </PubNub>
  );
};
```
