# Themes

UI Customization is an important part of every component library. PubNub Chat Components offer many
ways of customization depending on what kind of changes need to be applied in order to
achieve required results.

The most basic method of customizing PubNub Chat Component is changing between built in themes.
We offer light and dark modes for the three most common chat use cases. They differ in the basic
color palette and elements that are displayed or hidden on each type of chat. Supported themes are:

- light (default)
- dark
- support
- support-dark
- event
- event-dark

In order to change the default components theme an appropiate option needs to be changed on the Chat
provider:

```js
const MyCommponent = () => {
  return (
    <Chat theme="dark">
      // Add components here
    </Chat>
  );
};
```

Here are screenshots showing the MessageList in the 3 use case themes and what decisions were made
regarding what elements are shown in each and why:

### Group Chat

This type of chat assumes a conversation between multiple entities with a medium amount of messages.
Author of each message is clearly shown, including the name and avatar, if provided. Time of sending
the message is detoned as well. This type of chat will most often include message reactions
(`enableReactions`), rendering attachments and other complex features.

### Support Chat

Most often a suport chat is a 1 on 1 conversation between the user and some kind of support
assistant. Messages are clearly distinguished to ours/theirs by aligning them to different edges.
Name of the interlocutor does not have to be shown next to each message to save some space. Only the
avatar of support agent is shown since in most cases the end user is not required to provide it.
Complex features and can be disabled or enabled depending on your needs.

### Event Chat

Event Chats are likely to show hundreds of interactions at once from multiple users. Space needs
to be preserved in order to show as many messages as possible on a single screen. In this case
avatars and timestamps are not displayed at all, and names are renderer next to the message so that
they can fit in one line. We recommend disabling complex features like reactions here - they can make
it harder to navigate the chat.
