# React Chat Components (Beta)

PubNub's Chat Components library provides easy-to-use components to build chat applications using PubNub Chat on the React Framework. Our component library is the fastest way to add chat features like direct and group messaging, typing indicators, reactions and more without going through the complexity of low-level architecture of realtime networks. At the same time it allows you to create apps for various use cases, with different functionalities and customizable looks.

# Usage

## PubNub Account

1. Sign in or create an account to create an app on the [Admin Portal](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/) and get the keys to use in your
   application.

2. When you create a new app, the first set of keys is generated automatically, but a single app can
   have as many keysets as you like. We recommend that you create separate keysets for production and
   test environments.

3. Some of the functionalities you might want to enable on your keyset depending on the use-case
   include _Presence_, _Storage & Playback_ (including correct Renention) and _Objects_ (be sure to
   select a geographical region corresponding to most users of your application).

## Installation

Install the components and all required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install --save pubnub pubnub-react @pubnub/react-chat-components
```

## Usage

1. Import PubNub, PubNub React Provider and the components

```js
import PubNub from "pubnub";
import { PubNubProvider } from "pubnub-react";
import {
  Chat,
  MessageList,
  MessageInput,
  ChannelList,
  MemberList,
} from "@pubnub/react-chat-components";
```

2. Create your PubNub client and rest of the configuration for the Chat, which serves as a
   common context for all of the components:

```jsx
const pubnub = new PubNub({
  publishKey: "myPublishKey",
  subscribeKey: "mySubscribeKey",
  uuid: "myUniqueUUID",
});
const currentChannel = "myCurrentChannel";
const theme = "light";
```

3. Feed the PubNub Provider with your newly created client as with other PubNub React applications.

```jsx
const MyCommponent = () => {
  return <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}></PubNubProvider>;
};
```

4. Place the components within the Chat state provider in any order that your app requires. Components
   can be tweaked later on using option properties and CSS variables.

```jsx
const MyCommponent = () => {
  return (
    <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}>
      <Chat {...{ currentChannel, theme }}>
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Chat>
    </PubNubProvider>
  );
};
```

5. Check out the [PubNub Chat Components Documentation](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/docs)
   to learn more about how to use the components and the [PubNub Chat Components Samples](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/samples) to see what is possible using the components. Source code of the sample applications can be found in the `samples` folder in the repository root.
