<Meta title="Custom Hooks/useUserMemberships" />

## useUserMemberships

The hook returns a list of channel memberships for a user. This method doesn't return a user's subscriptions.
Pagination is handled internally, you can adjust the `limit` of returned channes on a single call (max/default 100) and call a function returned by the hook to get another page of results.
This hook also sets up a listener that will react to updates and removals of already fetched Channels.
However, this behavior requires a living subscription to the user getting updated - this should be handled by the components.

```js
const [channels, fetchPage, total, error] = useUserMemberships({ uuid: 'user' });

return (
  <Chat {...{ options }}>
    <ChannelList channelList={channels} />
  </Chat>
)
```
