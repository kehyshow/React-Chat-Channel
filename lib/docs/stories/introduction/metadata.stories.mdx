# Providing Users and Channels data

Some components require providing lists of Channels and Users that should be displayed. Some of
those work fine with simple lists of `strings`, although look much better when provided with
metadata about the entities. Please see the reference below to understand what's expected where and
why:

| Component       | Description                                                                                                     | Property                       | Data type (see below)                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ChannelList     | Displaying channel names along with descriptions                                                                | `channels`                     | `string[]` or `ChannelMetadataObject<ObjectCustom>[]` |
| MemberList      | Displaying full user names, avatars and additional line of text that can serve as user description/title/status | `members`                      | `string[]` or `UUIDMetadataObject<ObjectCustom>[]`    |
| MessageList     | Displaying full user names and avatars                                                                          | `users` of the `Chat` provider | `UUIDMetadataObject<ObjectCustom>[]`                  |
| TypingIndicator | Displaying full user names or avatars, depending on the type of the indicator                                   | `users` of the `Chat` provider | `UUIDMetadataObject<ObjectCustom>[]`                  |

# Storing Users, Channels and Memberships

Since all of the metadata has to be explicitly provided, Chat Components are indifferent regarding
where the data is coming from. However, it's possible to create Chat Applications with completely
serverless architecture. PubNub infrastructure allows you to store information about Channels, Users
and Memberships between the two, using **Objects** feautre. Please see links below to learn more
about it:

- [Blog Post](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/introducing-objects-v2-store-for-user-and-channel-metadata/)
- [JavaScript SDK](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript/api-reference/objects)

Once metadata is created and stored on PubNub servers, it's possible to easily fetch it and pass it
to the components using our custom **React hooks**. Please see the next page of the Introduction to
see how to achieve that.

# Data Types

<br />

### Channels

```
interface ChannelMetadataObject<ObjectCustom> {
  id: string;               // used as an unique channel identifier across the components
  name: string;             // displayed on the ChannelList (first line)
  description?: string;     // displayed on the ChannelList (second line)
  custom?: {                // not used in Chat Components by default, but can store additional data
    thumb?: string | null;  // expects an image URL to display the channel thumbnail
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
}
```

### Users

```
interface UUIDMetadataObject<ObjectCustom> {
  id: string;                  // used as an unique user identifier across the components
  name: string;                // displayed on Messages, Typing Indicator and Member List
  profileUrl?: string | null;  // expects an image URL to display the user avatar
  externalId?: string | null;  // not used in Chat Components
  email?: string | null;       // not used in Chat Components
  eTag: string;                // not used in Chat Components
  created: string;             // not used in Chat Components
  updated: string;             // not used in Chat Components
  custom?: {
    title?: string             // displays user title / description / status on the member list
    [key: string]: unknown;    // can store additional data
  };
}

```
