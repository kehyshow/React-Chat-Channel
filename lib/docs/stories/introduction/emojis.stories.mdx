# Emoji Pickers

The components listed below are able to interact with _emoji pickers_ in order to achieve following
functionalities:

- MessageInput - using emojis to compose text messages
- MessageList - reacting to certain messages with any of the available emojis

In order to keep the components library lightweight, and at the same time provide maximum
customizability, an emoji picker component is not included directly in the package. Instead, it is
expected it will be installed directly in your application and provided into react-chat-components
using _render props_.

## Expected interface

In order to use any emoji picker component of your choosing it has to expose a `onSelect` method
which is called whenever an emoji is picked by the user. In that method there is supposed to be a
single object argument which has a `native` property that returns a native emoji image that can be
rendered by your supported browsers.

A TypeScript interface that you can import from the components looks like this:

```tsx
interface EmojiPickerElementProps {
  onSelect?: ({ native: string }) => void;
}
```

## Examples

<br />

### emoji-mart

[emoji-mart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-mart) is a very popular, customizable emoji picker
component for React that is natively supported by react-chat-components. It uses the same interface
so the usage is plug-and-play:

1. Start by installing the package

```bash
npm install --save emoji-mart
```

2. Import the component and required styles

```tsx
import { Picker } from "emoji-mart";
import "emoji-mart/css/emoji-mart.css";
```

3. Use it in your chat app

```tsx
<Chat channel="channel">
  <MessageList enableReactions reactionsPicker={<Picker />} />
  <MessageInput typingIndicator emojiPicker={<Picker />} />
</Chat>
```

### emoji-picker-react (and others)

[emoji-picker-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-picker-react) is another popular choice to
provide emoji picking functionality. However, it uses a different interface so you have to write an
adapter before rendering it in the components:

1. Start by installing the package

```bash
npm install --save emoji-picker-react
```

2. Import the component (and a helpful interface if you are using TypeScript):

```tsx
import Picker, { IEmojiData } from "emoji-picker-react";
import { EmojiPickerElementProps } from "@pubnub/react-chat-components";
```

3. Implement an adapter:

```tsx
export const PickerAdapter = (props: EmojiPickerElementProps) => {
  // handling method should call onSelect with an object exposing a "native" property
  const handleEmoji = (event: React.MouseEvent, emoji: IEmojiData) => {
    if (props.onSelect) props.onSelect({ native: emoji.emoji });
  };
  // onEmojiClick is a method in emoji-picker-react used to handle emoji picking
  return <Picker onEmojiClick={handleEmoji} />;
};
```

4. Use it in your chat app:

```tsx
<Chat channel="channel">
  <MessageList enableReactions reactionsPicker={<PickerAdapter />} />
  <MessageInput typingIndicator emojiPicker={<PickerAdapter />} />
</Chat>
```
