# Error Handling

Passing wrong types of data into the components, unavailability or a limited network connection and
unexpected behaviors are all examples of what might cause exceptions to be thrown from inside of the
components code. The results of those problems might vary, starting with some interactions being
blocked and ending with your whole application crashing. That is why it is important to be able to
add some form of error handling to your usage of components.

<br />

## Error Callback

The fundamental way of capturing and handling errors coming from the components is by using the
`onError` property of `Chat` provider component and passing it a custom callback function. This
function will be called each time a JavaScript exception is raised within components code with the
actual Error passed in as an argument.

You can use the custom error callback for debugging, logging, as well as showing notifications to the
end user or recovery by re-rendering. An example of simple logging behavior can be as follows:

```js
function ErrorChat() {
  const [currentChannel, setCurrentChannel] = React.useState("test-channel");

  const onError = (error: Error) => {
    yourLogger.log(error.message);
  };

  return (
    <Chat {...{ currentChannel, onError }}>
      <MessageList />
      <MessageInput />
    </Chat>
  );
}
```

## Automatic Retries

In addition to the error callback, there is an automatic retry behavior built in for some of the
component functionalities (currently fetching messages history). It is disabled by default, but can
be easily configured for environments in which network connection is not too stable, and you don't
want the connections to fail immediately.

In order to enable this retry behavior you should configure the `retryOptions` property on `Chat`
provider. Pass in the maximum number of retries, timeout between requests and set a factor number
for exponential timeout lengths (1 will result in linear timeouts). In the example below, if the
network connection is down, the components will try to fetch message history up to 5 times, with
timeout between each request starting from 1 second, to 2s, 4s, and ending on 8 seconds before the
last call.

```js
function RetryChat() {
  const [currentChannel, setCurrentChannel] = React.useState("test-channel");

  const retryOptions = {
    maxRetries: 5,
    timeout: 1000,
    exponentialFactor: 2,
  };

  return (
    <Chat {...{ currentChannel, retryOptions }}>
      <MessageList />
      <MessageInput />
    </Chat>
  );
}
```
