# PubNub Access Manager

PubNub Access Manager (PAM) allows you to enforce secure controls for client access to resources
within the PubNub network. With PAM, your servers can grant their clients access to individual
PubNub resources for a limited duration, with the ability to extend access or add permissions for
additional resources.

With Access Manager enabled, your clients must have permissions to send requests to PubNub. You can
grant access to your clients from a secure server using the secretKey. These grants allow you to
granularly manage the resources available to each client. For instance, you can make a one-to-one
chat room private by only allowing the two users in that chat room to have read and write
permissions on the chat room channel. Alternatively, you can make a channel public by allowing all
users to have access to it.

More information about PAM can be found [here](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/security/access-control).

## PAM handling in components

PubNub Chat Components as a purely client-side React components library does not do anything
specific to handle PAM internally. Once PAM is enabled on the PubNub keyset, the developer is
expected to write custom code that would handle granting and revoking access, just as if the app was
written from scratch.

You can expect the operations listed below to be executed internally by the components. In order for
those to work properly all of them should be granted access to for the UUID passed to the PubNub
instance.
