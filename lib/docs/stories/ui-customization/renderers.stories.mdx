# Custom Renderers

In some applications using one of the themes and customizating it with CSS variables might not
be enough - you may need to completely change the HTML markup of the components, either to modify
the layout, or add new, custom features.

If that's the case you can use to most advanced, and the most flexible option of customization -
custom renderers. Most of the components come with one, or multiple properties with names ending in
`renderer` (like `messageRenderer` in MessageList component).

This kind of properties accept a function that should return an HTML/JSX structure. Input to the
function will differ depending on the particular renderer, but it is always data internally used to
create the default markup.

### Example

Code snippet below shows an example usage of MessageList's `messageRenderer` mentioned earlier. We
are using it to replace the default markup of each message. The function is fed with a message
object (message itself, attachments, reactions) along with user data, assuming that user metadata
was provided, timestamp of the message and a flag determining if the current user sent this message.

> Please note that if needed, the default features like message reactions and attachments rendering
> might need to be implemented as well or will not be shown at all.

```js
function ExampleChat() {
  const currentChannel = "example";

  const renderMessage = (props: MessageRendererProps) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>{props.message.sender?.name}</strong> {props.time}
        </p>
        <p>{props.message.message.text}</p>
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <Chat currentChannel={currentChannel}>
      <MessageList fetchMessages={10} messageRenderer={renderMessage} />
    </Chat>
  );
}

export default ExampleChat;
```
